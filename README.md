# Outreachy
Outreachy program 2015

This repository will be used to gather code, documentation, or any other
information I found useful for my application to the Outreachy program 2015.

I'm applying to OpenStreetMap, and my first choice of project is to develop a
OAM plugin to QGIS (https://github.com/hotosm/HOT-Project-Ideas/issues/6). My
first contribution to this project was the development of a plugin to upload
files via SSH (oam_plugin directory).

My second option of project is is to develop a translation workflow for LearnOSM
(https://github.com/hotosm/HOT-Project-Ideas/issues/13).
