# Outreachy

This repository will gather code and documentation used during my application to the Outreachy program 2015.

[QGIS OAM plugin](https://github.com/tassia/Outreachy/tree/master/oam_plugin)
My first contribution to the OAM team, a plugin to upload files via SSH.

INSTALL
This version only supports UNIX systems, since it depends on the [paramiko python library](http://www.paramiko.org/) for the SSH connection. The recommended way to get Paramiko is to install the latest stable release via pip:

$ pip install paramiko
