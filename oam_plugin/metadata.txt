description=This plugin can be used to tile local aerial imagery dataset and
    upload them to OAM. It implements the OAM upload API commands for sending
    ready-tiles to the main OAM server or a specific node. 
about=Imagery from satellites, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and other
    aircraft is becoming increasingly available after a disaster. It is often
    difficult to determine what is available and easily access it.
    OpenAerialMap (OAM) seeks to solve this by providing a simple open way to
    host and provide access to imagery for humanitarian response and disaster
    preparedness.
